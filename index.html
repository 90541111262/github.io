<h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
<hr>

<p>
<mark><b>My name is Carlos Aladim.</b></mark><br>
<br>
I'm a Brazilian graphic designer and art director with a specialization in marketing,<br>
and I'm 38 years old. Graphic design is a great passion in my life,I do my work with <br>
many criteria and always seek to evolve within my creative processes with a reference<br>
search and constant updating.<br>
</p>

<p>
<em>In 23 years of experience working in this area, I developed actions focused on planning,<br>
creation, and execution of editorial design, branding, and advertising projects, where<br>
I could work on the front line in many of them.</em>
